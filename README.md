App for children to learn the names of the most common birds

This app I developed for a 7-years-old boy. He came to school this year and with this app I want to support him in learning to read and write and I want him to know the names of the most common birds. I know, that he has a tablet Nexus 7, so this app is optimized for this tablet. If you have a smaller device, you have to scroll down, what I do not really like, but I didn't want the pictures to be too small.
By now I've only finished the first part – the reading part.

##Part 1 – Read the name of the birds and the text of the answer after commit
If you open the app, you see a friendly yellow smiley face, surrounded by pictures of birds. At the top of this app you see one name, the name of the selected bird. 
Please look for the right bird in the circle and touch it. Then the picture of this bird goes to the center of the circle. It is selected now. Click the button „OK“ to confirm your selection. If you are right, you will see the yellow smiley again and a suitable text. If you are wrong, you will see a red smiley and a text. Because you still see the picture of the bird in the center of the circle and the bird's name at the top, you can think about your selection again.
You can go on by touching another bird in the circle or another name in the spinner. 
Next to the name of the bird you see a little triangel. When you click this small triangle, a list with names appears. From this list you can choose a new name. A new picture you select by touching a new picture from the circle.
Please notice, the text varies depending on the selected bird.

##Part 2 – Writing the names of the birds
If you click the button „Reset“, you can start from the beginning. But this is only a preliminary function. I  plan to open a second page by clicking on this button. On this page I will present the same birds, but this time you have to type the bird's names yourself. So you can learn to write the names correctly.

##Internationalization
The app comes with an English and a German version. The language depends from the setting of your device. 
If you want to learn the names of the birds in German or English, so you only need to change the settings in your device. The default language is English. Spanish comes soon.

##further comments
This app is my very first app, based to the knowledge I have learned during the course „Android Development for Beginners“ with udacity and within the meetings „WTM Berlin Android Study Jam“ in Immobilienscou24 in 2016. Thanks to all organisers and voluntaries. I had no previous knowledge in Java or another similiar programming language. You helped me a lot to understand.

The smileys I created by myself. They are drawn with Pages. The photos were only edited by myself.

###Have fun playing this game and please, send me your feedback. I'm sure I want to go on with android developing.
